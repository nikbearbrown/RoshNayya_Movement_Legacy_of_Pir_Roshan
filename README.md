### Survey Paper: "The Roshaniyya Sufi Movement and Its Historical Impact in South Asia"

**Abstract:**
This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century in South Asia. The movement played a significant role in the socio-political and religious landscape of the region, particularly in Afghanistan and the surrounding areas. This paper synthesizes various scholarly works to explore the movement's origins, its spiritual and political philosophies, the conflicts it engendered, and its lasting impact on regional culture and society.

**1. Introduction**

The Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, emerged in the early 16th century in the rugged terrains of what is now modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. This movement quickly established itself as a significant spiritual, cultural, and socio-political force in South Asia. Bayazid Ansari's teachings and his establishment of the Roshaniyya Sufi order were deeply rooted in the mystical concept of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being). This philosophical doctrine, which suggests that all existence is unified in the divine essence, served as a cornerstone for the movement's spiritual framework and distinguished it from other contemporary Islamic and Sufi movements.

#### 1. **Historical Context and Emergence**

The emergence of the Roshaniyya movement must be understood against the backdrop of a period marked by political fragmentation, religious diversity, and social upheaval in South Asia. The 16th century was a time of considerable conflict and change, with the region experiencing the decline of established powers and the rise of new dynasties, such as the Mughals, who sought to consolidate their rule over the diverse religious and ethnic communities. In this milieu, Sufi movements often played crucial roles as mediators and cultural bridges, providing spiritual guidance and social cohesion to their followers. However, the Roshaniyya movement diverged from the mainstream Sufi orders of the time in its approach to both spiritual teachings and socio-political engagement.

Bayazid Ansari, born into a Pashtun family in the tribal areas of the Afghan-Pakistan border, was initially educated in Islamic sciences and Sufi teachings. He later developed his unique interpretation of Sufism, which he sought to propagate through his establishment of the Roshaniyya order. Unlike other Sufi movements that typically emphasized withdrawal from worldly affairs, Ansari's vision was more activist. He aimed to challenge the prevailing religious orthodoxy and the socio-political structures that he perceived as corrupt and unjust .

#### 2. **Foundational Principles: "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being)**

The philosophical underpinning of the Roshaniyya movement, "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," or "Unity of Being," is a concept that posits a monistic view of existence, where all creation is essentially one with the Divine. This idea, originally articulated by the medieval Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, was further developed by Bayazid Ansari to challenge the dualistic notion of separation between God and creation prevalent in orthodox Islamic theology. Ansari's interpretation emphasized that the divine is not only transcendent but also immanent within every aspect of creation, encouraging a direct, personal experience of the divine presence.

Ansari’s teachings advocated for the realization of the divine within oneself and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge through inner experience rather than external rituals or dogmatic adherence to religious laws. This stance was seen as a direct challenge to the ulema (Islamic scholars) who upheld a more literalist and legalistic interpretation of Islam. The Roshaniyya teachings promoted a mystical approach to understanding the Quran and Hadith, emphasizing allegorical and esoteric meanings over literal ones  .

#### 3. **Challenging Religious Orthodoxy and Socio-Political Norms**

The Roshaniyya movement was not merely a spiritual initiative; it was a radical challenge to both the religious orthodoxy and socio-political norms of its time. By advocating a mystical interpretation of Islam that downplayed the importance of religious authority and legalistic adherence, Bayazid Ansari directly confronted the established religious order. The movement's emphasis on personal spiritual enlightenment threatened the authority of the traditional Islamic scholars who derived their power from their role as interpreters of Islamic law and guardians of religious orthodoxy.

Additionally, the Roshaniyya movement's social and political ideas were revolutionary for their time. Bayazid Ansari envisioned a society where spiritual and temporal authority were united under a single moral and mystical framework. This vision included a critique of both the tribal chieftains and the burgeoning Mughal state, whom he saw as corrupt and oppressive. His movement attracted followers from various social strata, including marginalized tribal groups, by offering an alternative vision of community that transcended existing social hierarchies and political allegiances .

The movement’s socio-political activism also manifested in its direct confrontation with local rulers and tribal leaders who opposed Ansari's teachings and perceived the growing influence of the Roshaniyya movement as a threat to their power. This conflict escalated into armed confrontations, marking the movement as one of the few Sufi orders that not only engaged in spiritual discourse but also in active socio-political struggle .

#### 4. **Broader Cultural Implications and Legacy**

The Roshaniyya movement had profound cultural implications that extended beyond its immediate religious and political influence. It played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural and literary landscape of the Pashtun regions. The movement's teachings were disseminated not only through oral transmission but also through the development of a distinctive literary tradition. Bayazid Ansari himself authored several works in Pashto, thereby contributing to the development of Pashto literature and cultural identity.

Moreover, the movement's emphasis on the use of vernacular languages in spiritual discourse challenged the dominance of Persian and Arabic, which were the languages of the elite and the scholars. This helped elevate the status of the Pashto language and facilitated a broader cultural awakening among the Pashtun tribes. The Roshaniyya movement's promotion of Pashto as a literary and scholarly language had lasting effects on the cultural identity of the region, fostering a sense of unity and distinctiveness among its people .

In conclusion, the Roshaniyya Sufi movement represents a unique chapter in the history of South Asian Islam, blending spiritual mysticism with socio-political activism. It challenged both the religious orthodoxy and the socio-political status quo of its time, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence the cultural and religious landscape of the region.




**2. Origins and Foundational Principles**

Bayazid Ansari, a prominent Sufi mystic, established the Roshaniyya Sufi order in the first half of the 16th century in what is now modern-day Afghanistan.

Ansari initiated the "Roshaniyya Movement" to disseminate his ideas, advocating for spiritual enlightenment through self-realization and direct experience of the divine .

**3. Socio-Political Impact and Conflicts**

The Roshaniyya movement was not only a religious and spiritual movement but also had significant socio-political dimensions. It gained a following among various tribal groups in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, though it also faced strong opposition from other influential religious and tribal leaders .

**Main Findings:**
- The movement's socio-political aspect became evident as Bayazid Ansari's teachings attracted both support and opposition from various tribes. While some tribes recognized him as "Pir Roshan" (the Enlightened Spiritual Guide), others, particularly the Pakhtun tribes, viewed him as "Pir Tariq" (Heretical Spiritual Guide) .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's opposition highlights the complex interplay between religious authority, political power, and tribal loyalties in the region.

Future research should explore the movement's long-term effects on modern South Asian Sufism and its continuing relevance in contemporary spiritual discourses.
