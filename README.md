**1. Introduction**

The Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, emerged in the 16th century as a significant spiritual and socio-political force in South Asia. The movement, rooted in the concept of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being), aimed to propagate a form of Sufism that challenged both religious orthodoxy and socio-political norms. This paper provides an overview of the movement's foundational principles, its historical development, and its broader cultural implications.

**2. Origins and Foundational Principles**

Bayazid Ansari, a prominent Sufi mystic, established the Roshaniyya Sufi order in the first half of the 16th century in what is now modern-day Afghanistan. His teachings were grounded in the Sufi philosophy of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," emphasizing the unity of existence and the idea that all creation is a manifestation of a single divine reality . Ansari initiated the "Roshaniyya Movement" to disseminate his ideas, advocating for spiritual enlightenment through self-realization and direct experience of the divine .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Bayazid Ansari was a 'Wahdat-ul-Wajudi Sufi' who established and propagated the 'Roshaniyya Sufi Silsilah' in the first half of the sixteenth century A.D." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's foundation was deeply spiritual, focusing on personal enlightenment and mystical experiences as a path to understanding the divine nature of existence.

**3. Socio-Political Impact and Conflicts**

The Roshaniyya movement was not only a religious and spiritual movement but also had significant socio-political dimensions. It gained a following among various tribal groups in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, though it also faced strong opposition from other influential religious and tribal leaders .

**Main Findings:**
- The movement's socio-political aspect became evident as Bayazid Ansari's teachings attracted both support and opposition from various tribes. While some tribes recognized him as "Pir Roshan" (the Enlightened Spiritual Guide), others, particularly the Pakhtun tribes, viewed him as "Pir Tariq" (Heretical Spiritual Guide) .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's opposition highlights the complex interplay between religious authority, political power, and tribal loyalties in the region.

**4. Cultural and Literary Contributions**

The Roshaniyya movement also had a lasting impact on regional literature and culture. It contributed to the development of Pashto literature by establishing a literary school that produced significant works in the Pashto language and even introduced new letters to its alphabet .

**Main Findings:**
- The movement founded a mystical school that significantly impacted Pashto literature, promoting the use of Pashto in both religious and secular contexts .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshani movement founded a mystical school and produced literature that improved the Pashto language and added new letters to the Pashto alphabet." .

**Reasoning:**

**5. Comparative Analysis with Other Sufi Movements**

The Roshaniyya movement shared similarities with other contemporary Sufi movements in its approach to spirituality and its challenge to established religious authorities. However, its unique emphasis on direct experience of the divine and its integration of political activism distinguished it from other movements, such as the Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya and the Maijbhandari Sufi brotherhood  .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshani movement had political, economic, and social concepts in addition to being a religious movement and a conflict between Islamic religious groups." .

**Reasoning:**
The comparative analysis demonstrates the movement's distinct characteristics and its broader influence on regional Sufi traditions.

**6. Conclusion**

The Roshaniyya Sufi movement, under the leadership of Bayazid Ansari, was a transformative force in the 16th century that went beyond spiritual teachings to influence socio-political dynamics and cultural developments in South Asia. Its legacy is evident in the region's literature, religious practices, and ongoing cultural debates. Future research should explore the movement's long-term effects on modern South Asian Sufism and its continuing relevance in contemporary spiritual discourses.
