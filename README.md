### Survey Paper: "The Roshaniyya Sufi Movement and Its Historical Impact in South Asia"

**Abstract:**
This survey paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century in South Asia. The movement played a significant role in the socio-political and religious landscape of the region, particularly in Afghanistan and the surrounding areas. This paper synthesizes various scholarly works to explore the movement's origins, its spiritual and political philosophies, the conflicts it engendered, and its lasting impact on regional culture and society.

**1. Introduction**

The Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded by Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, emerged in the early 16th century in the rugged terrains of what is now modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. This movement quickly established itself as a significant spiritual, cultural, and socio-political force in South Asia. Bayazid Ansari's teachings and his establishment of the Roshaniyya Sufi order were deeply rooted in the mystical concept of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being). This philosophical doctrine, which suggests that all existence is unified in the divine essence, served as a cornerstone for the movement's spiritual framework and distinguished it from other contemporary Islamic and Sufi movements.

#### 1. **Historical Context and Emergence**

The emergence of the Roshaniyya movement must be understood against the backdrop of a period marked by political fragmentation, religious diversity, and social upheaval in South Asia. The 16th century was a time of considerable conflict and change, with the region experiencing the decline of established powers and the rise of new dynasties, such as the Mughals, who sought to consolidate their rule over the diverse religious and ethnic communities. In this milieu, Sufi movements often played crucial roles as mediators and cultural bridges, providing spiritual guidance and social cohesion to their followers. However, the Roshaniyya movement diverged from the mainstream Sufi orders of the time in its approach to both spiritual teachings and socio-political engagement.

Bayazid Ansari, born into a Pashtun family in the tribal areas of the Afghan-Pakistan border, was initially educated in Islamic sciences and Sufi teachings. He later developed his unique interpretation of Sufism, which he sought to propagate through his establishment of the Roshaniyya order. Unlike other Sufi movements that typically emphasized withdrawal from worldly affairs, Ansari's vision was more activist. He aimed to challenge the prevailing religious orthodoxy and the socio-political structures that he perceived as corrupt and unjust .

#### 2. **Foundational Principles: "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being)**

The philosophical underpinning of the Roshaniyya movement, "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," or "Unity of Being," is a concept that posits a monistic view of existence, where all creation is essentially one with the Divine. This idea, originally articulated by the medieval Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, was further developed by Bayazid Ansari to challenge the dualistic notion of separation between God and creation prevalent in orthodox Islamic theology. Ansari's interpretation emphasized that the divine is not only transcendent but also immanent within every aspect of creation, encouraging a direct, personal experience of the divine presence.

Ansari’s teachings advocated for the realization of the divine within oneself and the pursuit of spiritual knowledge through inner experience rather than external rituals or dogmatic adherence to religious laws. This stance was seen as a direct challenge to the ulema (Islamic scholars) who upheld a more literalist and legalistic interpretation of Islam. The Roshaniyya teachings promoted a mystical approach to understanding the Quran and Hadith, emphasizing allegorical and esoteric meanings over literal ones  .

#### 3. **Challenging Religious Orthodoxy and Socio-Political Norms**

The Roshaniyya movement was not merely a spiritual initiative; it was a radical challenge to both the religious orthodoxy and socio-political norms of its time. By advocating a mystical interpretation of Islam that downplayed the importance of religious authority and legalistic adherence, Bayazid Ansari directly confronted the established religious order. The movement's emphasis on personal spiritual enlightenment threatened the authority of the traditional Islamic scholars who derived their power from their role as interpreters of Islamic law and guardians of religious orthodoxy.

Additionally, the Roshaniyya movement's social and political ideas were revolutionary for their time. Bayazid Ansari envisioned a society where spiritual and temporal authority were united under a single moral and mystical framework. This vision included a critique of both the tribal chieftains and the burgeoning Mughal state, whom he saw as corrupt and oppressive. His movement attracted followers from various social strata, including marginalized tribal groups, by offering an alternative vision of community that transcended existing social hierarchies and political allegiances .

The movement’s socio-political activism also manifested in its direct confrontation with local rulers and tribal leaders who opposed Ansari's teachings and perceived the growing influence of the Roshaniyya movement as a threat to their power. This conflict escalated into armed confrontations, marking the movement as one of the few Sufi orders that not only engaged in spiritual discourse but also in active socio-political struggle .

#### 4. **Broader Cultural Implications and Legacy**

The Roshaniyya movement had profound cultural implications that extended beyond its immediate religious and political influence. It played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural and literary landscape of the Pashtun regions. The movement's teachings were disseminated not only through oral transmission but also through the development of a distinctive literary tradition. Bayazid Ansari himself authored several works in Pashto, thereby contributing to the development of Pashto literature and cultural identity.

Moreover, the movement's emphasis on the use of vernacular languages in spiritual discourse challenged the dominance of Persian and Arabic, which were the languages of the elite and the scholars. This helped elevate the status of the Pashto language and facilitated a broader cultural awakening among the Pashtun tribes. The Roshaniyya movement's promotion of Pashto as a literary and scholarly language had lasting effects on the cultural identity of the region, fostering a sense of unity and distinctiveness among its people .

In conclusion, the Roshaniyya Sufi movement represents a unique chapter in the history of South Asian Islam, blending spiritual mysticism with socio-political activism. It challenged both the religious orthodoxy and the socio-political status quo of its time, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence the cultural and religious landscape of the region.


**2. Origins and Foundational Principles**

### Expanded Section: Origins and Foundational Principles

Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, was a prominent Sufi mystic whose life and teachings significantly shaped the religious landscape of South Asia in the 16th century. Born into a Pashtun family in the tribal areas of the Afghan-Pakistan border, Ansari was exposed to diverse religious and cultural influences from an early age. He received a traditional Islamic education but soon diverged from orthodox teachings, developing his unique interpretation of Sufism, which emphasized direct spiritual experience and personal enlightenment over formal religious rituals and dogma.

#### 1. **The Founding of the Roshaniyya Sufi Order**

The Roshaniyya Sufi order, established by Bayazid Ansari in the first half of the 16th century, was rooted in his desire to promote a mystical understanding of Islam that transcended the rigid orthodoxy of his time. The name "Roshaniyya," derived from the Persian word "Roshani" meaning "light" or "illumination," reflects Ansari's emphasis on spiritual enlightenment and the inner illumination of the soul. This movement was part of a broader trend in Sufism that sought to internalize spiritual practices and focus on the individual's direct relationship with the divine, unmediated by clerical authority.

Ansari's establishment of the Roshaniyya order marked a significant departure from other Sufi orders, such as the Qadiriyya or the Chishtiyya, which were more established and widely accepted within the Islamic world. While these orders also emphasized love and devotion to God, they generally operated within the boundaries of orthodox Sunni Islam. In contrast, the Roshaniyya movement was more radical in its approach, questioning the prevailing socio-religious norms and advocating for a more personal and direct experience of God .

**Supporting Quote:**
- "Bayazid Ansari was a 'Wahdat-ul-Wajudi Sufi' who established and propagated the 'Roshaniyya Sufi Silsilah' in the first half of the sixteenth century A.D." .

#### 2. **Philosophical Underpinnings: "Wahdat-ul-Wajud" (Unity of Being)**

Central to the Roshaniyya Sufi order's teachings was the doctrine of "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," or "Unity of Being." This philosophy, which was originally articulated by the Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi, posits that all existence is fundamentally one with the divine essence. In other words, every aspect of creation is a manifestation of a single, unified divine reality. Ansari adopted and adapted this concept to develop his mystical framework, emphasizing that the divine is both immanent and transcendent, present in all things yet beyond all things.

This philosophical stance was revolutionary in its implications. It suggested that the divine could be experienced directly by anyone who sought it with sincerity and devotion, without the need for intermediaries like religious scholars or clerics. This was a direct challenge to the religious establishment, which derived much of its authority from its role as the gatekeeper of religious knowledge and practice .

By promoting "Wahdat-ul-Wajud," Ansari encouraged his followers to seek spiritual knowledge through personal introspection, meditation, and self-purification. He taught that the divine presence could be realized within oneself and that true spiritual enlightenment came from recognizing this inner divinity. This teaching was seen as a threat to the established religious order because it diminished the role of external religious rituals and the authority of the clergy, who were often seen as intermediaries between the layperson and the divine .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's foundation was deeply spiritual, focusing on personal enlightenment and mystical experiences as a path to understanding the divine nature of existence. This emphasis on direct experience of the divine was a key characteristic that set the Roshaniyya movement apart from more orthodox Islamic practices, which often emphasized external rituals and adherence to religious law.

#### 3. **The "Roshaniyya Movement": A Revolutionary Spiritual and Social Initiative**

### Expanded Section: The "Roshaniyya Movement": A Revolutionary Spiritual and Social Initiative

The "Roshaniyya Movement," founded by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century, represented a bold and revolutionary departure from the established socio-religious norms of its time. This movement was not just an introduction of a new Sufi order but a radical initiative that sought to transform both the spiritual consciousness and the socio-political dynamics of the region. Ansari's vision was deeply intertwined with his critique of the existing religious and social order, which he perceived as corrupt, oppressive, and spiritually bankrupt. 

#### 1. **Challenging the Socio-Political Structures**

Bayazid Ansari's establishment of the "Roshaniyya Movement" was driven by his desire to challenge the entrenched socio-political structures of his time, which he believed hindered true spiritual enlightenment and societal justice. Ansari's teachings critiqued the prevailing power dynamics that favored a small elite—both religious and political—over the general populace. He argued that these elites maintained their control through a rigid interpretation of Islam that emphasized external ritual and compliance with religious laws, rather than personal spiritual development and a direct relationship with the divine.

Ansari viewed these structures as inherently corrupt and sought to dismantle them through a spiritual and social revolution. He taught that true spiritual enlightenment could only be achieved by breaking free from the constraints imposed by religious orthodoxy and social hierarchies. This involved rejecting the authority of the traditional Islamic scholars (ulema) who were seen as gatekeepers of religious knowledge and were often aligned with political authorities to maintain the status quo .

The "Roshaniyya Movement" was characterized by its dual focus on spiritual and socio-political ideals. On the spiritual front, Ansari promoted a more inclusive and accessible interpretation of Islam that was oriented towards personal enlightenment and direct experience of the divine. This stood in stark contrast to the formalistic and hierarchical approaches prevalent in the established religious institutions of the time, which often emphasized strict adherence to ritual and law over personal spiritual development.

On the socio-political front, the movement advocated for a reformation of societal practices and norms. Ansari's teachings emphasized principles of social justice, equality, and the rejection of caste-like divisions that were prevalent in the tribal societies of the region. These divisions often mirrored the social hierarchies and feudal structures that dominated the political landscape. Ansari's critique extended to these social norms, which he saw as inherently unjust and contrary to the true spirit of Islam .

**Reasoning:**

#### 3. **Inclusivity and Accessibility in Religious Practices**

One of the revolutionary aspects of the "Roshaniyya Movement" was its emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility in religious practices. Ansari believed that spiritual knowledge and divine experience should not be confined to a privileged few but should be accessible to all, regardless of their social or economic status. This approach was in stark contrast to the prevailing religious practices, which were often characterized by exclusivity and a focus on outward piety and ritual.

Ansari's teachings encouraged his followers to seek spiritual knowledge directly from the divine source, rather than through intermediaries such as clerics or religious scholars. This was a radical departure from the norms of the time, which placed significant power in the hands of religious authorities who controlled access to religious knowledge and practices. By advocating for a direct, personal relationship with the divine, Ansari empowered individuals to take ownership of their spiritual journey, breaking down the barriers that had traditionally kept religious knowledge and experience out of reach for many .

The Roshaniyya Movement was also notable for its strong emphasis on social justice and equality. Ansari's teachings were grounded in the belief that all human beings are equal before God, and that social and economic inequalities were artificial constructs that needed to be dismantled. He criticized the social stratification and the caste-like divisions that were prevalent in the tribal societies of his time, arguing that these divisions were contrary to the principles of Islam, which advocated for equality and justice .

Ansari's call for social reform was not just theoretical; it had practical implications for the way his followers organized their communities and interacted with others. The movement encouraged its followers to engage in selfless service, cultivate humility, and treat all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their social or economic status. This emphasis on social justice and equality resonated with many who were marginalized by the existing socio-political structures, and it helped to attract a diverse following to the movement .

#### 4. **Critique of Religious Orthodoxy and Advocacy for Self-Realization**

### Expanded Section: Critique of Religious Orthodoxy and Advocacy for Self-Realization

A central theme in Bayazid Ansari's teachings within the Roshaniyya Sufi movement was his profound critique of the prevailing religious orthodoxy. Ansari's approach represented a significant departure from the dominant Islamic scholarly traditions of his era, which were characterized by a rigid, formalistic interpretation of religion that prioritized outward conformity and strict adherence to ritual and dogma. Ansari, however, championed an alternative path focused on self-realization and direct experience of the divine, emphasizing inner spiritual understanding over external religious practices. This advocacy for a more personal and experiential approach to spirituality directly challenged the established religious authorities and resonated deeply with those who felt marginalized by orthodox Islam.

#### 1. **Critique of Religious Orthodoxy: A Challenge to Established Authority**

Bayazid Ansari's critique of religious orthodoxy was rooted in his observation that the Islamic scholarly community of his time had become overly concerned with maintaining external forms of piety, such as ritual observance and adherence to religious law, often at the expense of cultivating a genuine inner spiritual life. Ansari believed that this rigid formalism resulted in a superficial understanding of Islam, one that emphasized compliance over spiritual growth and personal connection with the divine .

Ansari criticized this approach for being spiritually hollow and disconnected from the true essence of Islam, which he saw as a path to personal enlightenment and inner purification. He argued that the religious establishment's focus on external forms and legalistic interpretations served to maintain their power and control over the faithful, rather than fostering genuine spiritual development. In his view, the religious scholars (ulema) had become gatekeepers of a version of Islam that was more concerned with preserving social order and their own authority than with guiding believers toward true spiritual understanding .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Bayazid Ansari was a 'Wahdat-ul-Wajudi Sufi' who established and propagated the 'Roshaniyya Sufi Silsilah' in the first half of the sixteenth century A.D." .
- "The study presents a balanced and analytical approach of the teachings and techniques he adopted to propagate among the masses" .

**Reasoning:**
By critiquing the established religious orthodoxy, Ansari directly confronted the power structures of his time, advocating for a return to a more authentic, spiritually focused practice of Islam.

#### 2. **Advocacy for Self-Realization and Direct Experience of the Divine**

Central to the teachings of the Roshaniyya movement was the idea that true spiritual enlightenment could only be achieved through self-realization and direct, personal experience of the divine. Ansari believed that each individual had the potential to experience God directly, without the need for intermediaries such as clerics or scholars. This emphasis on personal spiritual experience was a radical departure from the dominant religious norms of the time, which often relied on a hierarchical model where religious knowledge and authority were concentrated among the ulema .

Ansari taught that the divine could be found within oneself, and that the path to spiritual enlightenment involved turning inward, seeking the divine presence through meditation, contemplation, and inner purification. This approach was inherently egalitarian, as it suggested that anyone, regardless of their social status or level of religious learning, could achieve spiritual enlightenment through sincere devotion and self-discipline. This was a stark contrast to the prevailing views that emphasized external conformity and adherence to a rigid set of religious laws and rituals as the primary means of religious observance .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya Movement called for a reformation of religious practices, promoting an interpretation of Islam that was more inclusive and accessible to the common people" .

**Reasoning:**
By advocating for self-realization and a direct relationship with the divine, Ansari's teachings offered a more personalized and accessible path to spiritual fulfillment, challenging the established religious norms and appealing to a broader range of followers.

#### 3. **Appeal to Marginalized Communities: Inclusivity and Empowerment**

Ansari's critique of religious orthodoxy and his advocacy for self-realization found a receptive audience among those who felt alienated by the formalism and exclusivity of orthodox Islam. His teachings particularly resonated with marginalized communities who were often excluded from the centers of religious and political power. By offering a path to divine understanding that did not depend on formal religious education or adherence to rigid social hierarchies, the Roshaniyya movement provided these communities with a sense of spiritual empowerment and inclusion .

For many, the movement's emphasis on inner spiritual experience over outward ritual offered a way to reclaim their spiritual agency in a religious landscape dominated by scholars and clerics who often acted as gatekeepers to religious knowledge. This appeal to the marginalized was further strengthened by the movement's emphasis on social justice, equality, and the rejection of caste-like divisions, which were prevalent in the region's tribal societies. Ansari's message of spiritual and social liberation thus found fertile ground among those who were most disillusioned with the existing socio-religious order .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement's focus on inclusivity and direct spiritual experience made it particularly appealing to those who were disenfranchised by the prevailing religious and social systems, helping to broaden its base of support.

#### 4. **Impact on Religious Thought and Practice: A New Paradigm**

The Roshaniyya movement's critique of religious orthodoxy and its advocacy for self-realization had a profound impact on religious thought and practice in the region. By challenging the authority of the religious scholars and promoting a more direct, personal relationship with the divine, the movement offered a new paradigm for understanding Islam that was more aligned with the mystical traditions of Sufism. This new approach emphasized personal spiritual development over outward conformity, encouraging believers to seek a deeper, more meaningful connection with God .

This shift in focus from external ritual to inner experience represented a significant change in the way religion was understood and practiced. It encouraged a more individualized approach to faith, one that was less dependent on the mediation of religious authorities and more focused on personal spiritual growth. This had the effect of democratizing religious knowledge and practice, making it more accessible to a wider range of people and fostering a more inclusive and spiritually dynamic religious community .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya movement founded a mystical school and produced literature that improved the Pashto language and added new letters to the Pashto alphabet" .

#### 5. **Conclusion**

In conclusion, Bayazid Ansari's critique of religious orthodoxy and his advocacy for self-realization were central to the revolutionary nature of the Roshaniyya movement. By challenging the established religious authorities and promoting a more direct, personal approach to spiritual experience, Ansari's teachings offered a new way of understanding and practicing Islam that was both more inclusive and more aligned with the mystical traditions of Sufism. This emphasis on personal spiritual growth and inner purification helped to democratize religious knowledge and practice, making it more accessible to a broader range of people and providing a powerful alternative to the rigid formalism of orthodox Islam.

#### 5. **Impact and Spread of the Movement**

### Expanded Section: Impact and Spread of the Movement

The Roshaniyya movement, initiated by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century, quickly garnered a substantial following among various ethnic and tribal groups in South Asia, particularly among the Pashtuns. The movement’s rapid spread can be attributed to several key factors, including Ansari's charismatic leadership, the revolutionary nature of his teachings, the strategic use of vernacular languages, and the movement's appeal to marginalized communities. These elements combined to create a powerful, grassroots spiritual movement that not only challenged the religious and social norms of the time but also left a lasting legacy in the region’s cultural and religious landscape.

#### 1. **Charismatic Leadership and Revolutionary Teachings**

Bayazid Ansari, also known as Pir Roshan, was a charismatic leader whose revolutionary ideas attracted a diverse array of followers. His teachings emphasized personal spiritual enlightenment, direct experience of the divine, and a critique of the established socio-political and religious orders. This combination of spiritual and social reform was particularly appealing to the Pashtuns, who were the primary ethnic group that rallied around Ansari's vision.

The Pashtuns, living in the tribal areas of what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan, were drawn to Ansari’s teachings because they resonated with their own experiences of marginalization and their desire for both spiritual and social autonomy. Ansari’s emphasis on equality, social justice, and a more personal, direct relationship with the divine challenged the existing power structures, both religious and political, that often excluded or oppressed them. His ideas provided a framework for resistance against external domination and internal hierarchies, appealing to the Pashtun ethos of independence and self-determination .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "Many tribes came under the influence of Bayazid and declared him Pir Roshan, but the majority of the opponents were Pakhtun tribes who were under the influence of Pir Baba and Akhund Darweza. They considered Bayazid to be a Pir Tariq because they found his teachings and preaching to be unlawful." .

**Reasoning:**
The movement’s appeal to the Pashtuns and other marginalized groups was not just spiritual but also political, offering a vision of society that was more inclusive and just.

#### 2. **Oral Transmission and Written Works in Pashto**

A critical factor in the spread of the Roshaniyya movement was the use of both oral transmission and written works to disseminate Ansari’s teachings. Oral transmission was a powerful tool in a largely illiterate society, allowing the movement’s ideas to be communicated directly to the people in their own language. Ansari and his followers used poetry, songs, and stories to spread their message, making it accessible to a wide audience. This approach not only ensured the rapid spread of the movement but also helped to build a strong sense of community and shared purpose among its followers .

In addition to oral transmission, Ansari made strategic use of written works in Pashto to solidify the movement’s influence and ensure its legacy. By choosing to write in Pashto, a vernacular language, rather than in Arabic or Persian, which were the languages of the religious and cultural elite, Ansari made a deliberate statement about the accessibility of spiritual knowledge. This decision was significant in challenging the dominance of Arabic and Persian, which were often seen as gatekeepers of religious authority and scholarly prestige .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya movement founded a mystical school and produced literature that improved the Pashto language and added new letters to the Pashto alphabet" .

**Reasoning:**
By producing written works in Pashto, Ansari not only promoted literacy and cultural pride among the Pashtuns but also democratized access to spiritual teachings, making them available to a broader audience beyond the traditional scholarly class.

#### 3. **Emphasis on Vernacular Languages: Challenging Elite Dominance**

The Roshaniyya movement’s emphasis on the use of vernacular languages in spiritual teachings was a revolutionary approach that significantly contributed to its spread and impact. At the time, Arabic and Persian were the dominant languages of religious scholarship and were associated with the elite class of Islamic scholars (ulema) and rulers. These languages were often inaccessible to the common people, who spoke their local vernaculars, such as Pashto. By advocating for the use of Pashto in spiritual discourse, Ansari effectively challenged the linguistic hegemony of Arabic and Persian, making religious knowledge more accessible and inclusive .

This emphasis on vernacular languages was not merely a linguistic choice; it was a deliberate political and spiritual strategy aimed at breaking down the barriers that excluded ordinary people from religious and spiritual discourse. It allowed Ansari to communicate directly with the people in their own language, fostering a deeper connection and resonance with his teachings. This approach helped to democratize religious knowledge, empowering those who had been marginalized by the existing socio-religious structures and enabling a more inclusive spiritual community .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya Movement called for a reformation of religious practices, promoting an interpretation of Islam that was more inclusive and accessible to the common people" .

**Reasoning:**
The use of vernacular languages like Pashto in spiritual teachings allowed the movement to reach a broader audience, including those who were often excluded from formal religious education, thus fostering a more inclusive and egalitarian spiritual community.

#### 4. **Grassroots Appeal and Empowerment of Marginalized Communities**

A key factor in the rapid spread of the Roshaniyya movement was its strong grassroots appeal, particularly among marginalized communities who found solace and empowerment in Ansari’s teachings. The movement’s message of spiritual and social liberation resonated with those who felt disenfranchised by the rigid hierarchies of the time, both religious and social. By emphasizing self-realization, direct experience of the divine, and the importance of inner spiritual purity over external ritual, the movement offered a path to spiritual fulfillment that was accessible to all, regardless of social status or formal religious training .

Ansari’s ability to articulate his vision in the language of the common people helped to democratize religious knowledge and empower those who had been marginalized by the existing socio-religious structures. This grassroots appeal was a key factor in the movement's rapid spread and its ability to attract a diverse following. The Roshaniyya movement became a vehicle for social change, promoting values of equality, justice, and spiritual autonomy that resonated deeply with its followers .

**Supporting Quotes:**
- "The Roshaniyya movement's advocacy for direct spiritual experience and self-realization was a radical departure from the dominant religious norms of the time" .

**Reasoning:**
The movement’s focus on inclusivity, equality, and spiritual empowerment helped to attract a broad cross-section of society, making it a powerful force for social and spiritual change in the region.

#### 5. **Lasting Legacy and Cultural Impact**

The impact of the Roshaniyya movement extended beyond its immediate spiritual and social influence to leave a lasting legacy on the cultural and religious landscape of South Asia. The movement’s promotion of Pashto as a language of spiritual discourse not only helped to elevate the status of Pashto in the region but also contributed to the development of a distinctive Pashto literary tradition. By fostering a sense of cultural pride and identity among its followers, the Roshaniyya movement helped to shape the cultural and religious consciousness of the Pashtun people .

The movement’s teachings on social justice, equality, and spiritual autonomy continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about Islam and society, highlighting its enduring relevance. The Roshaniyya movement’s legacy is evident in the ongoing efforts to promote inclusive and accessible interpretations of Islam that prioritize personal spiritual development and social justice, reflecting the core values of Bayazid Ansari’s vision .

#### 6. **Conclusion**

In conclusion, the rapid spread and lasting impact of the Roshaniyya movement can be attributed to its charismatic leadership, revolutionary teachings, strategic use of vernacular languages, and strong grassroots appeal. By challenging the existing religious and social hierarchies and promoting a more inclusive and accessible path to spiritual enlightenment, the movement attracted a diverse following and left a profound legacy on the cultural and religious landscape of South Asia. The Roshaniyya movement remains a powerful example of how spiritual and social reform can intersect to create lasting change and inspire future generations.

### Expanded Section: Conclusion

The Roshaniyya Sufi movement, founded and led by Bayazid Ansari in the 16th century, was far more than a spiritual reform initiative; it was a transformative force that reshaped the socio-political and cultural landscape of South Asia. The movement's emphasis on direct spiritual experience, social justice, and the use of vernacular languages in religious teachings had profound implications that extended beyond its immediate historical context. This section concludes the survey paper by synthesizing the key points discussed and highlighting the movement's enduring legacy and significance.

#### 1. **A Multifaceted Impact: Spiritual, Socio-Political, and Cultural**

The Roshaniyya movement's impact was multifaceted, affecting not only the spiritual lives of its followers but also the socio-political dynamics and cultural development of the region. On a spiritual level, Bayazid Ansari’s teachings emphasized self-realization and a direct, personal experience of the divine, which challenged the established religious orthodoxy and offered a more accessible and egalitarian path to spiritual fulfillment. This approach democratized religious knowledge, making it accessible to a broader audience beyond the traditional religious elite, and fostered a more inclusive spiritual community .

In terms of socio-political impact, the movement critiqued the existing power structures, both religious and political, that maintained social inequalities and perpetuated the marginalization of certain groups. By promoting ideals of social justice, equality, and spiritual autonomy, the Roshaniyya movement provided a framework for resistance against both internal hierarchies and external domination. This dual focus on spiritual and social liberation made the movement a powerful force for change, attracting a diverse following and fostering a sense of unity and purpose among its adherents .

Culturally, the Roshaniyya movement's emphasis on the use of vernacular languages, particularly Pashto, in spiritual teachings had significant implications for the region's cultural development. By choosing to write and disseminate his teachings in Pashto, Ansari not only elevated the status of the language but also contributed to the development of a distinct Pashto literary tradition. This cultural contribution helped to shape the identity of the Pashtun people and left a lasting legacy on the region’s literary and cultural landscape .

**Supporting Quotes:**

By promoting an interpretation of Islam that emphasized inner spiritual experience over external ritual, the movement helped to cultivate a religious culture that valued personal spiritual growth and direct communion with the divine .

This legacy continues to influence contemporary religious practices in South Asia, particularly among Sufi communities that value mystical experience and personal connection with God. The Roshaniyya movement’s emphasis on social justice, equality, and inclusivity also resonates in ongoing cultural and religious debates, reflecting its enduring relevance in the region’s spiritual discourse .

The movement's core principles—emphasizing direct spiritual experience, social justice, and the democratization of religious knowledge—remain relevant in contemporary discussions about the role of religion in society and the nature of spiritual authority. These principles resonate with many who seek a more inclusive and accessible approach to spirituality that prioritizes personal experience and social justice over rigid orthodoxy and hierarchical structures .

Future studies could explore the movement’s influence on later Sufi orders and its interactions with other religious and cultural movements in the region. Additionally, research could examine how the movement’s emphasis on vernacular languages and cultural identity has shaped regional literature and cultural expressions over time .
